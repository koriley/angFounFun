This is Foundation 6 and Angularjs.

Okay, to be honest, all I did here was install Foundation 6 (http://foundation.zurb.com/) from the Foundation-cli (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli).
I then added Angularjs 1 (https://angularjs.org/).

In js/app.js I have the start of a controller.

In index.html, this is the basic template loaded from Zurb, I added the angular stuff and named the app (you will most likely want to rename that).

scss/main.scss is for your sass stuff. (you may have to use !important for some elements).

Once you get it installed and you are ready to start developing, run npm start. This will start a web server and should launch a browser with live updates.
